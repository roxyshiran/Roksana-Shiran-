##introduction

The aim to visualize the random data of different occupation and income and age in Canada. 


##data 

Random data collected from Generatedata.com [https://generatedata.com/]
 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| output: false
# Read data 
Book1 <- readxl::read_excel("/Users/roksanashiran/Desktop/course/Book1.xlsx", skip = 1)

# Convert 'Experience (Years)' to numeric
Book1$`Experience (Years)` <- as.numeric(as.character(Book1$`Experience (Years)`))

# Check and remove NAs
Book1 <- filter(Book1, !is.na(`Experience (Years)`))
# Display a summary of the data
summary(Book1)
# Plotting the distribution of experience
ggplot(Book1, aes(x = `Experience (Years)`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Experience Years", x = "Years of Experience", y = "Count")
# Set the experience window
window_start <- 0
window_end <- 10

# Filter data
filtered_data <- Book1 %>%
  filter(`Experience (Years)` >= window_start & `Experience (Years)` <= window_end)

# Display the head of the filtered data
head(filtered_data)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
summary_table <- Book1 %>%
  group_by(Occupation) %>%
  summarize(
    Average_Experience = mean(`Experience (Years)`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Experience = median(`Experience (Years)`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Average_Age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Age = median(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )
print(summary_table)
```



```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Book1, aes(x = `Experience (Years)`, y = Age, color = Occupation)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Experience Years vs. Age by Occupation",
       x = "Years of Experience",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()

# Box plot for Experience by Occupation
ggplot(Book1, aes(x = Occupation, y = `Experience (Years)`, fill = Occupation)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Experience Years by Occupation",
       x = "Occupation",
       y = "Years of Experience") +
  theme_minimal()

# Box plot for Age by Occupation
ggplot(Book1, aes(x = Occupation, y = Age, fill = Occupation)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age by Occupation",
       x = "Occupation",
       y = "Age") +
theme_minimal()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(Book1, aes(x = `Experience (Years)`, y = Age, color = Occupation)) +
geom_col(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Experience Years vs. Age by Occupation",
       x = "Years of Experience",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(Book1, aes(x = `Experience (Years)`, y = Age, color = Occupation)) +
  geom_abline(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Experience Years vs. Age by Occupation",
       x = "Years of Experience",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(Book1, aes(x = `Experience (Years)`, y = Age, color = Occupation)) +
  geom_area(alpha=0.6) +  # Use geom_point() for scatter plots
  labs(title = "Experience Years vs. Age by Occupation",
       x = "Years of Experience",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()


```

##conclution
This analysis has elucidated significant trends within the workforce regarding experience years, age, and occupation in Canada.
